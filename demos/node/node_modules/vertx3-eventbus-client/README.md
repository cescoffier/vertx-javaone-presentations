## Changelog

**Changes from the 3.0.x to 3.1**

* IMPORTANT: The API has been changed to be compatible with node.js and to be closer to the vert.x eventbus API
.Creating  the bridge is made using `var eb = new EventBus("http://localhost:8080/eventbus");` instead of `new vertx
.EventBus...`. In addition, registering a handler use the node convention: 
`eb.registerHandler("metrics", function(err, res) {...}` instead of `ev.registerHandler("metrics", res)`.
* The file name has been updated to `eventbus-client.js`
